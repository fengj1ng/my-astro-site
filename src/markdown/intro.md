# Welcome.

### A little bit about me...

My name is Fengjin Cui and I am currently a software engineer in the Seattle area where I also sing with the Seattle Symphony Chorale and conduct the Amazon Symphony Orchestra.
I studied computer science, music, physics, and complex systems at the University of Michigan and enjoyed taking a variety of courses like organic chemistry, machine learning, distributed systems, network theory, and evolution in silico.
Throughout my undergrad, I also sang and toured with the University of Michigan Men's Glee Club, made a few cool things at Shift Creator Space, and am fortunate to have studied conducting with Kenneth Kiesler.
I try to practice piano every day and enjoy playing basketball whenever I can.

As you can see, I've taken interest in many things and am still putting things together. In the meantime, I hope you enjoy what I have on here so far!
